# Overview

As a software engineer committed to continuous learning and improvement, I developed the Flashcard App to explore and deepen my understanding of React Native and mobile app development practices. This project served as an opportunity to implement and refine skills such as state management, navigation between screens, data persistence with AsyncStorage, and the overall design and user experience of mobile applications.

The Flashcard App enhances learning and memory retention by leveraging the proven flashcard study method. Users can create flashcards for various subjects, enabling a personalized and interactive learning experience. Each flashcard consists of a question or term and an answer or definition.

How to Use:

1. Creating Flashcards: Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a simple interface showcasing existing flashcards, if any. To add a new flashcard, tap the "Add new set" button, enter the title, question (or term), and answer (or definition), then press "Save."

2. Studying with Flashcards: Select a flashcard from the main list to view its details. Tap on the flashcard to reveal the answer. This interaction facilitates active recall, which is critical for effective learning.

3. Editing and Deleting: Each flashcard detail view provides options to edit or delete the flashcard, allowing users to keep their study material current and relevant.

The creation of this app aligns with my broader goal of developing educational tools that leverage technology to foster learning, engagement, and accessibility. The Flashcard App aims to provide a convenient and effective study aid for learners of all ages and backgrounds by simulating the traditional flashcard study method in a digital format.
